    <p>Byrne re-introduces a notion originally popularized by persons such as 
        Madame Blavatsky and Norman Vincent Peale that thinking about certain things will make them appear in one's life. 
        Byrne provides examples of historical persons who have allegedly achieved this. 
        Byrne cites a three-step process: ask, believe, and receive. This is based on a 
        quotation from the Bible's Matthew 21:22: "And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, 
        ye shall receive." Byrne highlights the importance of gratitude and visualization
         in achieving one's desires, along with alleged examples. 
         Later chapters describe how to improve one's prosperity, relationships, and health, 
         with more general thoughts about the universe.</p>
    <p>The Secret is a 2006 self-help book by Rhonda Byrne, based on the earlier film of the same name. 
            It is based on the belief of the pseudoscientific law of attraction,
             which claims that thoughts can change a person's life directly.The book alleges energy as assurance of 
             its effectiveness. The book has sold 30 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 50 languages. 
             Scientific claims made in the book have been rejected by a range of critics, 
            pointing out that the book has no scientific foundation.</p>
